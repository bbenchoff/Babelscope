# Babelscope
Massively parallel emulator framework for computational space exploration

## âœ¨ What It Does

Babelscope treats executable code as a search space. Each GPU thread becomes a virtual 6507-based microcomputer, running a small ROM for thousands of clock cycles, and reporting behavioral fingerprints: I/O patterns, memory access, TIA signal structure, and system stability.

Rather than hand-authoring software, Babelscope **searches for it**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- GPU-accelerated 6507 CPU emulation with per-thread state
- Lightweight TIA and RIOT emulation based on NTSC timing models
- ROM generation and mutation directly on the GPU
- Output filtering for "interesting" behaviors: TIA register hits, VSYNC/VBLANK control, etc.
- Extensible scoring/detection framework for emergent structure and stability

---

## ðŸ“¦ Use Cases

- Discover unexpected visual effects, logic loops, or audio states from random ROMs
- Explore software behavior as a computational search space
- Fuzz micro-architectures in parallel
- Experiment with evolutionary design, emergent logic, or "aesthetics of code"

---

## âš¡ Status

**Pre-alpha.** Building core components:
- 6507 instruction set emulation in CUDA
- TIA emulation driven by NTSC scanline clock
- Basic runtime framework and filtering pipeline

---

## ðŸ§  Philosophy

Babelscope is a computational telescope.  
Instead of stargazing, it scans the program universe.
